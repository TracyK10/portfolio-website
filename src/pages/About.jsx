            Thanks for scrolling this far! I'm a junior full-stack developer
            from Nairobi, Kenya, creating eye-catching websites and diving into
            innovative ideas. I started with SheCodes for front-end, Moringa
            School for full-stack, and I'm now finishing my Mathematics and
            Computer Science degree at Multimedia University. Initially drawn to
            medicine, I discovered my true passion in programming
            <span className="emphasis"> (and sometimes UI/UX)</span> and now
            love solving real-world problems with code and connecting with
            fellow tech enthusiasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than coding, I watch tv shows, knit, workout and volunteer at
            my church as a counsellor for teenagers.ðŸ¤“ I've also been trying to
            read more so feel free to reach out to me with any book
            recommendations! âœ¨
